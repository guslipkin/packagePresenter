# Other options

format:
  # lack of `functions:`
# Excluding the `functions:` section is the same as setting all slides to 'true'. This will show all slides for which content exists.

format:
  theme: {default, ...}
# see https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#using-themes
# this is passed directly to the quarto document

functions: {auto, exported, all, none}
# 'auto' uses exported functions and internal functions in the same file as an exported function
# 'exported' uses only exported functions
# 'all' The default behavior, but should be there if the yml file exists

datasets: {all, none}
# 'all' The default behavior, but should be there if the yml file exists
# 'none' No datasets will be included
