  # lack of `functions:`
# Excluding the `functions:` section is the same as setting all slides to 'true'. This will show all slides for which content exists.

  theme: {default, ...}
# see https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html#using-themes
# this is passed directly to the quarto document

# 'exported' uses only exported functions
# 'all' The default behavior, but should be there if the yml file exists
