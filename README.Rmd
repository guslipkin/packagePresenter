The goal of `pkgslides` is to make it easier for you to learn about R packages by converting existing documentation into an easily digested slideshow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pkgslides from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("guslipkin/pkgslides")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which will build and render a [Quarto RevealJS](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) presentation for `pkgslides`:

```{r include=FALSE}
file.remove("_pkgslides.yml")
```

```{r example}
pkgslides::build_presentation()
```
